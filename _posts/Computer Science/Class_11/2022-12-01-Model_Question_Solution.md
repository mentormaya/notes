## Q.No. 1. What is computer? Describe about the characteristics of Computer  

---
A computer can be more accurately defined as an electronic device that takes data as input, stores and processes it and displays the output according to either the given instructions or the instructions stored in their memory unit.  
The physical parts that make up a computer (the central processing unit, input, output, and memory) are called hardware. Programs that tell a computer what to do are called software. A set of instructions that perform a particular task is called a program, software program, or software. Peripherals are any hardware device connected to a computer, any part of the computer outside the CPU and working memory. Some examples of peripherals are keyboards, the mouse, monitors, printers, scanners, disk and tape drives, microphones, speakers, joysticks, plotters, and cameras. Computer is an advanced electronic device that takes raw data as input from the user and processes these data under the control of set of instructions (called program) and gives the result (output) and saves output for the future use. It can process both numerical and non-numerical (arithmetic and logical) calculations.  

### The major characteristics of a computer can be classified into speed, accuracy, diligence, versatility, and memory which are as follows

>* Speed: The computer can process the data and give the output in fractions of seconds such that required information is given to the user on time enabling the user to take the right decisions at the right time. A powerful computer can execute about 3 million calculations per second.
>  
>* Accuracy: Inspire of its high speed of processing, the computers accuracy is consistently high enough which avoids any errors. If there are any errors, they are due to errors in instructions given by the programmer or input data.  
>
>* Versatility: The computer is versatile in nature in the sense of working and purpose. What that means is we can use the computer in any way we want. For example, if we need some graphics work, we can install the graphics software and we can design and accomplish our graphics work at the same time. Later if we need some report writing we can certainly install the word processing software and accomplish that also on the same computer we have used as a graphics designer. Similarly, we can do any work if the application for the same is available to us. That’s why the computer is said to be versatile.  
>
>* Automation: Once the instructions are fed into the computer it works automatically without any human intervention until the completion of execution of program until meets logical instructions to terminate the job.  
>
>* Reliability: The output generated by the computer is very reliable, but it is reliable only when the data which is passing as input to the computer and the program, which gives instructions are correct and reliable.  
>
>* Diligence: A computer can perform millions of tasks or calculations with the same consistency and accuracy. It doesn’t feel any fatigue or lack of concentration. Its memory also makes it superior to that of human beings.  
>
>* Storage: The computer has a provision to store large volumes of data in the small storage devices, which have the capacity to store huge amounts of data and help the retrieval of data an easy task.

## Q.No. 2. What are the measurements unit of processing speed and storage unit? Describe the relationship between various storage units  

---
The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is the part of the machine that retrieves and executes instructions. An arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), a control unit, and multiple registers make up the system. The processor is a common term for the central processing unit (CPU). These are also called the unit of electromagnetic (EM) wave frequency.

>The different measurement units and their relationship are as follows:  
1,000 Hz = 1 Kilo Hertz (103 Hz)  
1,000 KHz = 1 Mega Hertz (106 Hz)  
1,000 MHz= 1 Giga Hertz (109 Hz)  
1,000 GHz= 1 Tera Hertz (1012 Hz)

The size of the device in computers does not reflect the space available to store data in it. There are larger devices that can store only a few data were as many tiny devices as possible that store an unbelievable amount of data. It is also one type of measurement unit.  
Hence, we need to find some other way to measure space. All the digital computers use binary numbering systems (though there are some exceptions).
The binary numbering system consists of only two digits – 0 and 1 to represent any quantity. 10 in binary is equal to the 2 and 100 to 5. Everything in computers is represented in strings of binary numbers. For example, capital A is interpreted by the computer as 0100 0001 and B is 0100 0010. All characters, numbers, symbols, images, sounds, animations, videos, and everything is converted into suitable binary code to store on a computer or processed by computer.  
So, if there is any device that can store one binary digit (whether 0 or 1), its storage capacity is 1 bit. Here, we have larger units that represent a group of lower units. A group of 4 binary digits is called a nibble (4 bits = 1 Nibble). Similarly, a group of 8 bits is called a byte (1 byte = 8 bits).
As you have seen in the example above, each character requires 8 bits which are 1 byte. So, 1 character requires 1-byte space. Now, if you have a text file whose size is 32 bytes, it means there are 32 x 8 binary digits (0s and 1s) stored in it.
Following table lists the different units and their values:

>| Storage Measurement Units | Units Equivalent |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 0 or 1 | 1 Bit |
| 4 Bits | 1 Nibble |
| 8 Bits | 1 Byte |
| 1024 Bytes | 1 Kilobyte (KB) |
| 1024 Kilobytes | 1 Megabyte (MB) |
| 1024 Megabytes | 1 Gigabyte (GB) |
| 1024 Gigabytes | 1 Terabyte (TB) |
| 1024 Terabytes | 1 Petabyte (PB) |
| 1024 Petabytes | 1 Exabyte (EB) |

## Q.No. 3. What are the different types of computers based on size and power?  

---
Computer can be classified in many ways. The common way is to classify the computer according to working principle, purpose, and size. There are different types of computers.  

### Size and power wise computers can also be classified into four types

1. _Micro Computer or personal computers:_  
A microcomputer is a computer whose CPU is a microprocessor. A microprocessor is a processor all whose components are on a single integrated circuit chip.  
Personal computers are a kind of kind of microcomputer. Personal computers are called so because they are designed for personal use of individual or individual small business units’ office automation unit or professionals. Pc can be used for variety of applications like computer literacy, fun and games, business applications, programming etc.  

   >Types of Micro Computer or personal computers  
   >
   >* Desktop Computer
   >* Laptop Computer
   >* Palmtop Computer, Digital Diary, Notebook, PDAs.

2. _Minicomputer:_  
They are smaller versions of the mainframes. Generally, they offer the same computing power as bigger counterparts. The most important advantage of a minicomputer over the main frame is that it is cheaper in cost, smaller in size and reliable. It does not require air conditioning and can be operated in room temperature.  
Main used of these systems is in education in local government word processing etc. in business they are being used for involving stock payroll etc. it is generally used as server system on networks with personal computers as nodes.

   >Some typical machines– TDC 316, PDP 11/70, Honeywell (XPS-100), HCL-4.

3. _Mainframe Computer:_  
They are very big in size and offer the maximum computing power. Many peripherals can be attached to them. They are generally used in large networks of computers with the mainframe being the model point of the network. They used satellites for networking.  
A typical application is the airline system. It has a mainframe computer at their head office where information on all the fights is stored. Small computers are installed at the booking offices are attached to central data bank, so that up-to-date information of all flights is always available.

   >Some computers are – Univac 1100/10, Univac 1100/60, Honeywell DSP 88/860, IBM 270/168 etc.

4. _Supercomputer:_  
They are the most expensive of all the computers. These computers are big general-purpose computers capable of executing more than 10,000 million instructions per second and have storage capacities of millions of bits per chip. These computers are used to solve multi- variate mathematical problems such as atomic nuclear and plasma physics seismology, aerodynamics etc.
Supercomputers are typically capable of handling hundreds of millions of floating points operations per second (MFLOPS). The speed of super computers generally measured in “FLOPS” (Floating Point Operations Per Second).
Super computers are used for highly calculation- intensive tasks such as weather forecasting, climate research, molecular modeling, physical simulation, and cryptanalysis and military and Scientific agencies are heavy users.

>Some super computers are – Cray 1, Cray 2, Cray 3 perform 10 billion operation per second, Param, Cyber 810&830 etc.
