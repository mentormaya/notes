## **1. Database Management System (DBMS)**

### **1.1 Introduction to data, database, Database system, DBMS**

A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified rules, produce information (output), and store the information for future use.  
The physical parts that make up a computer (the central processing unit, input, output, and memory) are called hardware. Programs that tell a computer what to do are called software. A set of instructions that perform a particular task is called a program, software program, or software. Peripherals are any hardware device connected to a computer, any part of the computer outside the CPU and working memory. Some examples of peripherals are keyboards, the mouse, monitors, printers, scanners, disk and tape drives, microphones, speakers, joysticks, plotters, and cameras. Computer is an advanced electronic device that takes raw data as input from the user and processes these data under the control of set of instructions (called program) and gives the result (output) and saves output for the future use. It can process both numerical and non-numerical (arithmetic and logical) calculations.

## **2. Data Communication and Networking**

### **2.1 Basic elements of Communication System:**

Communication is the act of transmission of information. Every living creature within the world experiences the necessity to impart or receive information, virtually unceasingly, with alternatives in the closed world. For communication to be successful, it’s essential that the sender and the receiver perceive a standard language.
Humans have perpetually created endeavors to enhance the standard of communication with other human beings. Languages and the ways utilized in communication have been unbroken, evolving from prehistoric to fashionable times, to fulfil the growing demands in terms of speed and quality of information.  

Communication System that relies on the electronics means is known as Electronic Communication Systems and similarly Digital Communication System if the electronics are digital which are mostly used these days.

i. Information Source  
ii. Transmitter  
iii. Communication Channel  
iv. Receiver  
v. Destination

***Information Source:***  

We know that communication systems are the art of information exchange. Therefore, to establish communication we need some type of information. This information originates from the information source.  
> The information generated by the source may be in the form of sound (human speech), picture (image source), words etc.
{: .prompt-tip}

***Transmitter:***  

The transmitter is a device which converts the signal produced by the source into a form that is suitable for transmission over a given channel or medium. Transmitters use a technique called modulation to convert the electrical signal into a form that is suitable for transmission over a given channel or medium.  

When we send the signal over larger distances, it undergoes various circumstances which makes the signal weak. To send the signals over larger distances, without the effect of any external interferences or noise addition and without getting faded away, it must undergo a process called modulation. Modulation increases the strength of a signal without changing the parameters of the original signal. Thus, the resulting signal overcomes the various effects which make it become weak.  

***Communication Channel:***

The communication channel is a medium through which the signal travels.  

>***Communication channels are divided into two categories:***
>
>i. Guided Channel  
>ii. Unguided Channel
>
>If the channel does not allow the signal following through the medium to escape out of medium, then it is said to be Guided Medium or channel otherwise it is Unguided Channel or Medium. For example, wired communication systems use guided medium as wire and wireless communications systems use unguided medium as open space.
{: .prompt-tip}

***Receiver:***

The receiver is a device that receives the signal from the channel and converts the signal back to its original form (light and sound) which is understandable by humans at the destination.  

***Destination:***

The destination is the final stage in the communication system. Generally, humans at some places are considered as the destination. A destination is a place where this information is supposed to be consumed.

### **2.2 Concept of Communication System**

The word Communication (derived from the Latin ‘Communicare’ it means ‘to share’) is the act of sharing ideas, emotions, and feelings between two or more people.  

We are aware of the need for and importance of communication as it is a general phenomenon. Nowadays communication is playing a vital role in every step of an individual. Wherever life exists, communication also exists.

The history of communication itself can be traced back since the origin of speech. The use of technology in communication may be considered since the first use of symbols about 30,000 years BCE. Among the symbols used, there are cave paintings, petroglyphs, pictograms and ideograms. Writing was a major innovation, as well as printing technology and, more recently, telecommunications and the Internet.

The history of telecommunication - the transmission of signals over a distance for the purpose of communication - began thousands of years ago with the use of smoke signals and drums in Africa, America and parts of Asia. In the 1790s the first fixed semaphore systems emerged in Europe however it was not until the 1830s that electrical telecommunication systems started to appear.

### **2.4 Elements of Data Communication/Transmission**

[Refer to 2.1](/posts/Theory_12_Notes/#21-basic-elements-of-communication-system)

### **2.5 Simplex, Half duplex and Full duplex communication mode**

Data communication happens in the form of signals between two or more computing devices or nodes. The transfer  of  data  happens over a point-to-point  or multipoint communication channel. Data communication between different devices are broadly categorised into 3 types: Simplex communication, Halfduplex communication, and Full-duplex communication.

***Simplex Communication System***

In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive. The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction.
Example: Keyboard and traditional monitors. The keyboard can only introduce input, the monitor can only give the output.

***Half Duplex Communication System***

In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. While one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa. The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time. The entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for each direction.
Example: Walkie-talkie in which message is sent one at a time and messages are sent in both directions.

>Channel capacity = Bandwidth * Propagation Delay

### **2.6 Concept of LAN and WAN**

***LAN***  

A local area network (LAN) is a network confined to a small, localized area. Home WiFi networks and small business networks are common examples of LANs. Typically, whoever manages the LAN also manages the networking equipment it uses. A small business, for instance, will manage the routers and switches involved in setting up the LAN.  

***WAN***  

A wide area network (WAN) is a large computer network that connects groups of computers over large distances. WANs are often used by large businesses to connect their office networks; each office typically has its own local area network, or LAN, and these LANs connect via a WAN. These long connections may be formed in several different ways, including leased lines, VPNs, or IP tunnels.

### **2.7 Transmission Medium: Guided and Unguided**

A transmission medium is a system or substance that can mediate the propagation of signals for the purposes of telecommunication. Signals are typically imposed on a wave of some kind suitable for the chosen medium. For example, data can modulate sound, and a transmission medium for sounds may be air, but solids and liquids may also act as the transmission medium. Vacuum or air constitutes a good transmission medium for electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves. While material substance is not required for electromagnetic waves to propagate, such waves are usually affected by the transmission media they pass through, for instance, by absorption or reflection or refraction at the interfaces between media. Technical devices can therefore be employed to transmit or guide waves. Thus, an optical fiber or a copper cable is used as transmission media.  

>For any networking to be effective, raw stream of data is to be transported from one device to other over some medium. Various transmission media can be used for transfer of data. These transmission media may be of two types −
>
>***Guided Medium***  
>
>In guided media, transmitted data travels through cabling system that has a fixed path. For example, copper wires, fibre optic wires, etc.
>
>***Unguided Medium***  
>
>In unguided media, transmitted data travels through free space in form of electromagnetic signal. For example, radio waves, lasers, etc.

### **2.8 Transmission impairments terminology**

In the data communication system, analog and digital signals go through the transmission medium. Transmission media are not ideal. There are some imperfections in transmission mediums. So, the signals sent through the transmission medium are also not perfect. This imperfection cause **signal impairment**.

It means that signals that are transmitted at the beginning of the medium are not the same as the signals that are received at the end of the medium that is what is sent is not what is received. These impairments tend to deteriorate the quality of analog and digital signals.  

### Causes of impairment

***Jitter***

 Jitter is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably periodic signal, often in relation to a reference clock signal. In clock recovery applications it is called timing jitter. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links.

 Jitter can be quantified in the same terms as all time-varying signals, e.g., root mean square (RMS), or peak-to-peak displacement. Also, like other time-varying signals, jitter can be expressed in terms of spectral density.

 Jitter may be caused by electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with carriers of other signals. Jitter can cause a display monitor to flicker, affect the performance of processors in personal computers, introduce clicks or other undesired effects in audio signals, and cause loss of transmitted data between network devices. The amount of tolerable jitter depends on the affected application.

***Echo***

As the name implies, echo in communication systems is the return of a talker's voice. It is most apparent to the talker himself or herself. Secondarily, it can also be an annoyance to the listener. To be an impairment, the returned voice must suffer some noticeable delay. Thus we can say that echo is a reflection of the voice. The cause of echo is impedance mismatches that might be present any place in the electrical communication connection. Echo is a major annoyance to the communication user. It affects the talker more than the listener. Two factors determine the degree of annoyance of echo: its loudness and its length of delay.

***Singing***

Singing is the result of sustained oscillations due to positive feedback in communication amplifiers or amplifying circuits. Circuits that sing are unusable and promptly overload multiplex equipment, particularly FDM equipment.

Singing may be regarded as echo that is completely out of control. This can occur at the frequency at which the circuit is resonant. Under such conditions the circuit losses at the singing frequency are so low that oscillation will continue, even after cessation of its original pulse.

***Crosstalk***

In electronics, crosstalk is any phenomenon by which a signal transmitted on one circuit or channel of a transmission system creates an undesired effect in another circuit or channel. Crosstalk is usually caused by undesired capacitive, inductive, or conductive coupling from one circuit or channel to another.

Crosstalk is a significant issue in structured cabling, audio electronics, integrated circuit design, wireless communication and other communications systems.

***Distortion***

Distortion means that the signal changes its form or shape. Distortion can occur in a composite signal made of different frequencies. Each signal component has its own propagation speed (see the next section) through a medium and, therefore, its own delay in arriving at the final destination. Differences in delay may create a difference in phase if the delay is not exactly the same as the period duration. In other words, signal components at the receiver have phases different from what they had at the sender. The shape of the composite signal is therefore not the same. Figure below shows the effect of distortion on a composite signal.  

![DISTORTION](/assets/images/distortion.png)

***Noise***

Noise is another cause of impairment. Several types of noise, such as thermal noise, induced noise, crosstalk, and impulse noise, may corrupt the signal. Thermal noise is the random motion of electrons in a wire which creates an extra signal not originally sent by the transmitter. Induced noise comes from sources such as motors and appliances. These devices act as a sending antenna, and the transmission medium acts as the receiving antenna. Crosstalk is the effect of one wire on the other. One wire acts as a sending antenna and the other as the receiving antenna. Impulse noise is a spike (a sig- nal with high energy in a very short time) that comes from power lines, lightning, and so on. Figure below shows the effect of noise on a signal.  

![NOISE](/assets/images/noise.png)

***Bandwidth***

It is the maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).  

Bandwidth is how much information you receive every second, while speed is how fast that information is received or downloaded. Let's compare it to filling a bathtub. If the bathtub faucet has a wide opening, more water can flow at a faster rate than if the pipe was narrower. Think of the water as the bandwidth and the rate at which the water flows as the speed.

***Number of receivers***

Number of devices or reciever connected to the communication system consumes some amount of power from the signal comming from the channel. Hence connecting recievers of devices to the network directly effect the performance and efficiency of the communication system. To omit these kinds of power issue we can use the power boosters or power injection technique. Although in digital network the more no of clients or reciver connected to the router or network devices may result in network congestion which may result in slower network and less efficient network.
