## **1. Database Management System (DBMS)**

### **1.1 Introduction to data, database, Database system, DBMS**

A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified rules, produce information (output), and store the information for future use.  
The physical parts that make up a computer (the central processing unit, input, output, and memory) are called hardware. Programs that tell a computer what to do are called software. A set of instructions that perform a particular task is called a program, software program, or software. Peripherals are any hardware device connected to a computer, any part of the computer outside the CPU and working memory. Some examples of peripherals are keyboards, the mouse, monitors, printers, scanners, disk and tape drives, microphones, speakers, joysticks, plotters, and cameras. Computer is an advanced electronic device that takes raw data as input from the user and processes these data under the control of set of instructions (called program) and gives the result (output) and saves output for the future use. It can process both numerical and non-numerical (arithmetic and logical) calculations.

## **2. Data Communication and Networking**

### **2.1 Basic elements of Communication System:**

Communication is the act of transmission of information. Every living creature within the world experiences the necessity to impart or receive information, virtually unceasingly, with alternatives in the closed world. For communication to be successful, it’s essential that the sender and the receiver perceive a standard language.
Humans have perpetually created endeavors to enhance the standard of communication with other human beings. Languages and the ways utilized in communication have been unbroken, evolving from prehistoric to fashionable times, to fulfil the growing demands in terms of speed and quality of information.  

Communication System that relies on the electronics means is known as Electronic Communication Systems and similarly Digital Communication System if the electronics are digital which are mostly used these days.  

> ***The basic components of a communication system are***  
>
i. Information Source  
ii. Transmitter  
iii. Communication Channel  
iv. Receiver  
v. Destination

***Information Source:***  

We know that communication systems are the art of information exchange. Therefore, to establish communication we need some type of information. This information originates from the information source.  
> The information generated by the source may be in the form of sound (human speech), picture (image source), words etc.

***Transmitter:***  

The transmitter is a device which converts the signal produced by the source into a form that is suitable for transmission over a given channel or medium. Transmitters use a technique called modulation to convert the electrical signal into a form that is suitable for transmission over a given channel or medium.  

When we send the signal over larger distances, it undergoes various circumstances which makes the signal weak. To send the signals over larger distances, without the effect of any external interferences or noise addition and without getting faded away, it must undergo a process called modulation. Modulation increases the strength of a signal without changing the parameters of the original signal. Thus, the resulting signal overcomes the various effects which make it become weak.  

***Communication Channel:***

The communication channel is a medium through which the signal travels.  

>***Communication channels are divided into two categories:***
>
>i. Guided Channel  
>ii. Unguided Channel
>
>If the channel does not allow the signal following through the medium to escape out of medium, then it is said to be Guided Medium or channel otherwise it is Unguided Channel or Medium. For example, wired communication systems use guided medium as wire and wireless communications systems use unguided medium as open space.

***Receiver:***

The receiver is a device that receives the signal from the channel and converts the signal back to its original form (light and sound) which is understandable by humans at the destination.  

***Destination:***

The destination is the final stage in the communication system. Generally, humans at some places are considered as the destination. A destination is a place where this information is supposed to be consumed.

### **2.2 Concept of Communication System**

The word Communication (derived from the Latin ‘Communicare’ it means ‘to share’) is the act of sharing ideas, emotions, and feelings between two or more people.  

We are aware of the need for and importance of communication as it is a general phenomenon. Nowadays communication is playing a vital role in every step of an individual. Wherever life exists, communication also exists.

The history of communication itself can be traced back since the origin of speech. The use of technology in communication may be considered since the first use of symbols about 30,000 years BCE. Among the symbols used, there are cave paintings, petroglyphs, pictograms and ideograms. Writing was a major innovation, as well as printing technology and, more recently, telecommunications and the Internet.

The history of telecommunication - the transmission of signals over a distance for the purpose of communication - began thousands of years ago with the use of smoke signals and drums in Africa, America and parts of Asia. In the 1790s the first fixed semaphore systems emerged in Europe however it was not until the 1830s that electrical telecommunication systems started to appear.

### **3.1 Introduction**

A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified rules, produce information (output), and store the information for future use.  
The physical parts that make up a computer (the central processing unit, input, output, and memory) are called hardware. Programs that tell a computer what to do are called software. A set of instructions that perform a particular task is called a program, software program, or software. Peripherals are any hardware device connected to a computer, any part of the computer outside the CPU and working memory. Some examples of peripherals are keyboards, the mouse, monitors, printers, scanners, disk and tape drives, microphones, speakers, joysticks, plotters, and cameras. Computer is an advanced electronic device that takes raw data as input from the user and processes these data under the control of set of instructions (called program) and gives the result (output) and saves output for the future use. It can process both numerical and non-numerical (arithmetic and logical) calculations.
